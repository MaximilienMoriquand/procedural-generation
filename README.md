## Installation

You'll need both [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) and [perlin_noise](https://pypi.org/project/perlin-noise/#description)

```bash
pip install -U matplotlib
pip install perlin-noise
```

## Usage
The map will be in the folder map.

```bash
python3.9 procedural-generation.py
```
You can change the texture of the tile in the tiles file

## Possible amelioration 

I'm currently on intense work (last year in engineer school, EPITA srs rpz), I can't do as much as i want to do with this project.
Currently, I'm thinking about some amelioration:

    - Optimisation with datascience panda tools
    - Doing json parsing for custom class ( currently on this, but I don't know if I'll finish soon)
    - Graphical application
    - GPU computing with CUDA bridge (just dreaming ;-) ).

Feel free to fork, raise an issue or even propose a fork I'll be glad to see someone continues my project.

Made with stress, coffee and love. (I swear i did not do this instead of my homework lol)
